# Peltarion developer programming assignment


Assignment:
Create the game Tic-tac-toe as a web application where two players can play against each
other. The purpose is to have a piece of code written by you to use as a foundation for talking
about your approach to solving a programming project.

Game rules:

Tic-tac-toe ​is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row
wins the game. X goes first.

Requirements:

● The game should be playable in two different browser windows

● The game should have a server part and a client part (both shall be implemented by you)

● The following languages can be used for the server part: Java, Javascript or Python

Guidelines:

● Keep it simple (i.e. fancy high-score lists, searching for opponents and so on are
non-values)

● Use 3rd party libraries with moderation and try to find the right balance

● If there are priorities to be made, we prefer you implementing a smaller set of features
using your own code, rather than use a large framework.

Bonus task(s)

If you feel like it, also solve one or more of these bonus tasks. This is not strictly required but will
naturally be taken into consideration and cater for more interesting discussions during the tech
interview.

● Spectator support - i.e. visitors that cannot affect the game state

● Multi-game support - i.e. many games can be played simultaneously at different url:s,
one user flow could be this:

1. One user creates a new game
2. User selects X or O
3. User gets unique url to the game
4. User can invite other player by sending the game url

● Multi-game reconnect-support - i.e. users can reconnect to the game by logging in on the
same url

● Network connectivity issues - i.e. handle bad network conditions gracefully

● Persistence - i.e. game state can be resumed after server restart
